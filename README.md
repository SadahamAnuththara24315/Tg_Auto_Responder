This is a auto responder to Telegram user account. I also use this. Now I describe code.

Step 1

Frist you want to get your api_id and your api_hash. You can get it from [this](https://www/my.telegram.org).
In this site first you want to verify your number. After verify your number, Click Api development tools. Then give name to your project and give a short name.

Then you can get your api id and your api hash. Then replace your api id to apiId variable as a Intiger, and replace your api hash to apiHash varible as a String.

Step 2

After that if you want to send file(photos, files) with messages replace file's derect link to dp variable. If you do not need it, you can remove 'file=dp' in ..., ..., ... lines.
